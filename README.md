# ur8@n d1C710n@ry (Urban Dictionary)
## A web app using Sinatra and API calls to UrbanDictionary.com and a l33t sp33k translator.

This app was mainly an experiment in API calls and playing with a Sinatra MVC model. It allows users to register, look up definitions in Urban Dictionary, and read it in both regular English and [l337 sp3@k](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leet).

Yay for nerd culture!

# TO RUN

This app is currently not deployed anywhere. To use:

- Clone the repository locally
- From the terminal, run 'bundle install'
- Run the server locally with [shotgun](https://github.com/rtomayko/shotgun).
- When the browser is running, in your browser, go to [localhost:9393](localhost:9393)
- Enjoy! Save and share! I'm hoping to deploy soon, please let me know if you have any feedback on good resources to deploy to. Otherwise, I'll probably Rails-ify this when I have time and deploy to heroku.
